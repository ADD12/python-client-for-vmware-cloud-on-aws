# What's New - November 14, 2022
In this latest release, all commands have been refactored to use a command / sub-command syntax.  This provides for greater ease of use, as commands can be grouped by category.  Furthermore, a comprehensive argument framework has been implemented (argparse) which allows for passing parameters via the command line for better support for scripting. 

For example, in previous versions BGP prefix filters for your route-based VPN could only be created interactively at the command line.  Now, however, prefix lists can be imported as JSON files to make it a lot easier to update your T0 route table via script for specific use cases - e.g. disaster recovery.

### New Features:
 - all commands refactored to use argument parsing with python argparse module
 - moving forward, all commands will be updated (over time) to use standardized create / update / delete verbs (CrUD) where applicable
